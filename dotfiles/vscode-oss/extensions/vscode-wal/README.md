# **HELP ME!**

I do not have enough time to devote to this project. I need your help. If you have a little bit of time and a little programming skill, you can gladly make a pull request.
You can find documentation for vscode themes [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).
You can also share this project to other fans of pywal who maybe want to do something for the community. 
Thank you very much.

# CAUTION

Use this software very **carefully**, it is currently in **alpha**. I can't be held responsible for any possible bugs.
