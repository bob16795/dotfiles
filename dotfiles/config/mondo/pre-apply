# This script is executed before anything else, 
# when mondo is executed with the apply option (-a).

# The intension of this script is to let you prepare
# your environment before applying a new theme.

# For instance one might want to kill certain processes
# before applying, since some programs might overwrite
# the new settings with the old.
