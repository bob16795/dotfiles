# This script is executed every time a theme is generated.

# The default syntax is bash, but by changing the shebang,
# one could use another language (f.i. perl or python).

# $1 is equal to: $MONDO_DIR/generator/TYPE/THEME[.extensions]

# If this script is not needed, this file can safely be removed.
# (removing the file, will improve executioni speed)
